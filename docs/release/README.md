What is MAMEUI?
===============
MAMEUI has an inbuilt front-end allowing you to run a game from a list. It requires Windows 7 or later.


How to compile?
===============

You can only build MAMEUI on a Windows computer. It won't compile on Unix.

```
make OSD=messui
```

You must use GCC 10.1 - later versions will compile but crash at start.
